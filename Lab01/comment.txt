Comments of the varius plots:

# values Jitter:DDP and Shimmer:DDA dropped

# Regression lines plots
The value R^2 could be considered equal in both cases

# Error distribution
For the test set, SD has a higher density of error around the mean
Not a gaussian distribution but there is not overfitting


# Dropping motor_UPDRS
R^2 goes negative for DP and close to zero for LLS when the converge
